# Sum Things
## Overview
This repo contains a supplement for the following paper:

[*Carleton and Groucutt "Sum things are not what they seem: Potential problems with point-wise interpretations and quantitative analyses of summary radiocarbon-date proxies".*](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yp38j/)

## Abstract
Radiocarbon-date proxies are widely used in studies exploring long-term variation in human and environmental phenomena. Examples include variation in past human population levels and climate-change-driven sea level fluctuations. These processes are thought to have affected the amount of organic carbon deposited into the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record at a given time. Time-series representing through-time fluctuations in the frequency of dated radiocarbon samples are, therefore, often used as proxies for such processes. However, there are important problems with radiocarbon-date proxies that have so far gone underappreciated in the scientific literature. The primary problem is that the proxies are easily misinterpreted. They conflate process variation and chronological uncertainty, which makes them unsuitable for point-wise comparisons aimed at identifying rates of change, comparing variables directly, or estimating parameters in regression models. Here we explore the interpretive and analytical problems in detail in an effort to raise awareness and promote skepticism about the use of established radiocarbon date proxies in point-wise comparisons. We also, however, provide suggestions for future research and potential methodological alternatives that may improve the viability of dates-as-data approaches.

## Revisions
This repo used to contain code relevant to an earlier version of the paper noted above. After receiving helpful feedback on that draft, the paper has been revised substantially. It is now more a critical review than a simulation study. The simulation portion of the paper has been streamlined and moved to the supplement. That analysis really is only supplemental to the main points of the paper.

For the new version of the paper, we have created an R Markdown file detailing the simulation and analysis. The markdown file can be found in the [wiki associated with this repo](https://github.com/wccarleton/sumthings/wiki/replication).

The older code used in the simulation portion of the first paper is still available, though, in this repo's history using the following hash: *cef3404787e8b3fe913a3188d10907e6ddb3a0e0*. That commit occurred on November 12, 2019.

The first version of the paper that appeared in the SocArXiv is still available there.
